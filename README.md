# Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM

This repository contains the code for the Sentiment Analysis using LSTMs project, which I mentored during SOC'24. If you want to attempt this project on your own, please refer to the complete roadmap available [here](https://github.com/dionreji/SOC-24_Sentiment_analysis_and_Text_generation.git).

In this project, I have trained a Many-to-One LSTM model to predict IMDB movie ratings based on the textual content of movie reviews. The model is designed to analyze sentiments and accurately predict ratings, providing valuable insights into user reviews.
